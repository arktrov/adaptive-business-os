# ADR 0007: PostgreSQL production persistence

Status: Accepted for Phase 1 hardening. PostgreSQL is canonical production persistence; the domain depends on ports, while JSON remains development/test adapter. Schema is versioned under db/migrations. REVIEW_REQUIRED: select and validate the concrete TypeScript PostgreSQL driver before production deployment.

## PostgreSQL final acceptance pass — 2026-09-14
Docker Compose PostgreSQL is running healthy on localhost:55432. Migration 001 executed successfully; five tables, foreign keys and unique constraints verified. src/persistence-postgres.js provides transactional create/transition/getJob operations with optimistic state versioning and tenant-scoped reads. Integration script verified DB idempotency, audit coupling, concurrency rejection and tenant isolation. The app server still defaults to JSON unless DATABASE_URL wiring is enabled; REVIEW_REQUIRED before production use.

## Phase 1 final closeout — 2026-09-14
DATABASE_URL selects the PostgreSQL adapter; absent value selects JSON development fallback. Docker Compose command: docker compose up -d postgres. Migration: Get-Content db/migrations/001_control_plane.sql -Raw | docker exec -i adaptive-business-os-postgres psql -U abo_dev -d adaptive_business_os. App: $env:DATABASE_URL='postgres://abo_dev:abo_dev_password@localhost:55432/adaptive_business_os'; npm start. PostgreSQL clean-schema migration, adapter transaction/concurrency/idempotency/tenant checks and real app Business/Job/Detail flow passed. REVIEW_REQUIRED remains for full 24-case DB matrix and evidence/artifact API persistence before claiming final acceptance.
