# Master state

Date: 2026-09-13. Phase: **0 — foundation; implementation not authorized**.

## Verified baseline

- GitHub account `arktrov` (numeric ID 328814414) explicitly confirmed by owner. Repository `arktrov/adaptive-business-os` already existed, public and empty. Reuse it; no duplicate creation or visibility change.
- Intended checkout: `C:\Users\zelih\Documents\Codex\adaptive-business-os`.
- External renderer: `C:\Users\zelih\Documents\Codex\arktrov-remotion`; not a Git checkout. Its files were inspected without modifying production sources.
- ARKTROV Drive connection verified. Bootstrap specification and quality-gate specification read in full.
- Master Database: 14 sheet tabs inventoried; headers, Settings, System Map and selected production/asset records inspected. This is not a complete row-by-row data audit.
- Drive Render Queue has incoming, processing, completed, failed. V004 V4 job, result and handoff inspected: SUCCEEDED render result, eight visual shots, nine assets, 53.92s voice timing, 55s initial visual plan. Asset QA is Pending/null. No publish approval follows from that success.
- Existing tests: 14/14 pass; TypeScript check passes; V002 and V003 project runtime validation passes.
- Make blueprints received: **0**. No full scenario behavior, API configuration or scenario count verified.

## Deliverable boundary

Foundation documents, ADRs, source provenance and an import location. Architectural choices are proposals unless marked as binding invariants. No application, provider integration, new production run, migration, deployment or publishing has been started.

## Source precedence

Owner requirements define scope. Existing code and source artifacts establish observed behavior; Make blueprints, when supplied, establish legacy scenario behavior. New target behavior is governed by versioned decisions and mandatory gates, not assumed parity. Differences must be explicit.

## Open work

Complete Make intake and cross-scenario audit. Then obtain approval for the next implementation phase. Resolve missing execution-engine choice, provider capability validation, production QA thresholds and account-specific publishing capabilities before production.

The workbook still says human approval is required. The requested V005 autopublishing path needs an explicit versioned business-policy choice during implementation; current foundation grants no publishing permission. Human approval can add a condition but never waive QA.

See [risks and baseline](EXISTING_SYSTEM.md), [migration](MAKE_MIGRATION.md) and [validation](VALIDATION.md). The root Git commit records the foundation revision; remote synchronization is verified at delivery, not assumed by this file.
